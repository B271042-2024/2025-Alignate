1. Add/Remove Groups:
	- Press <code>+Group</code> to add a new group.

		- Conservation Percentage Calculation (against the reference group)
			- Overall group conservation:
				- Displayed in the consensus row of each group.
			- Secondary structure conservation (% in helices and beta sheets).
				- Display by hovering over predicted secondary structures.

<b>Additional Details</b>
1. Secondary Structure Prediction:
	- The secondary structure is predicted using the first sequence in the reference group. This approach reflects a real, biologically valid sequence, offering more meaningful insights than using a computational consensus sequence. 
2. Conservation Analysis:
	- Conservation percentages are calculated by comparing each group's consensus sequence to the reference group.
