<b>Introduction</b>
This software was designed to assist protein analysis for polymorphisms, allowing users to focus on group-based comparisons. It accepts FASTA format of both protein and codon sequences, aligns, predicts secondary structure and calculates their conservation percentage.


<b>Installation</b>
1. GitHub page - https://github.com/B271042-2024/2025-Alignate.
2. README file is provided for guidance on required package installations.
3. This software is Linux compatible. To use on Windows, please install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
4. Additional requirements:
	- tcsh shell			[to install on Linux/wsl: sudo apt install tcsh]
	- python			[to install on Linux/wsl: sudo apt-get install python(version?)]


<b>How to run on Linux/WSL</b>
./run.sh


<b>Supported formats</b>
Input	: .fasta, .fa, .txt, input text	(only FASTA format). Max length is 1000 bases.
Output	: .alignate, .fa, .txt, .png, .pdf


<b>Usage workflow</b>
<b><i>Protein</i></b>
1. Add Group by pressing button '+Group'. To remove, please press button '-Group'.
2. Add amino acid sequences by pressing button '+'. To remove, please tick the relevant checkboxes in rows containing sequences and press button '-'.
3. To compare sequences between groups, add more groups and sequences.
4. Select reference group by ticking the box. Default is the first group. Secondary structure is built using the first sequence from reference group.
5. Begin analysing sequences:
	a. Two modes:
		- To analyze one group, press button 'Align' in the respective group.
		- To analyze all groups together, press button 'Align all' at the top of the page.
	b. Analysis includes:
		- Sequence alignment
			- Two modes:
				a) ClustalO v1.2.2 	(parameters: default)
				b) MAFFT v7.526		(parameters: --anysymbol, --genafpair,--maxiterate 10000)
		- Consensus generation (Default threshold is 0.5)
			- Global consensus sequences
				- Positioned at the bottom of the page.
			- Group consensus sequences
				- Positioned in each group, below sequences
		- Color % conservation in each column by using the percentage of the most common base. Color: Purple (highly conserved) to white
		- Calculate conservation percentage by using group consensus. All are done against reference group.
			- Overall conservation percentage of each group.
				- %Conservation is positioned in each group, in consensus row.
			- Conservation percentage of each group in secondary structure (alpha helix and beta sheet ONLY).
				- %Conservation is positioned in each group, below consensus row.
		- Secondary structure prediction via PSIPRED V4
			- Two modes:
				- Default: PSIPRED with BLAST+
				- If not found, PSIPRED single will be used (No BLAST+)
			- Run Online or offline

<b><i>Codon</i></b>
1. Add Group by pressing button '+Group'. To remove, please press button '-Group'.
2. Add codon sequences by pressing button '+'. To remove, please tick the relevant checkboxes in rows containing sequences and press button '-'.
3. To compare sequences between groups, add more groups and sequences.
4. Select reference group by ticking the box. Default is the first group. Secondary structure is built using the first sequence from reference group.
5. Begin analysing sequences:
	a. Two modes:
		- To analyze one group, press button 'Align' in the respective group.
		- To analyze all groups together, press button 'Align all' at the top of the page.
	b. Analysis includes:
		- Translation of codon sequences into amino acid sequences
		- Sequence alignment
			- Alignment of amino acid sequences. Two modes:
				a) ClustalO v1.2.2 	(parameters: default)
				b) MAFFT v7.526		(parameters: --anysymbol, --genafpair,--maxiterate 10000)
			- Alignment of codon sequences using tranAlign
				a) This mode aligns codon sequences based on the aligned amino acid sequences to retain the properties of amino acid sequences.
		- Consensus generation
			- Global consensus sequences
				a) Codon consensus
					- Positioned at the bottom of the page
				b) Amino acid consensus
					- Positioned below codon consensus at the bottom of the page (color: orange)
			- Group consensus sequences
				a) Codon consensus
					- Positioned in each group, below sequences
				b) Amino acid consensus
					- Positioned in each group, below codon consensus (color: orange)
		- Color % conservation in each column by using the percentage of the most common base. Color: Purple (highly conserved) to white
		- Calculate conservation percentage by using group consensus. All are done against reference group.
			- Overall conservation percentage of each group.
				- %Conservation is positioned in each group, in consensus row.
			- Conservation percentage of each group in secondary structure (alpha helix and beta sheet ONLY).
				- %Conservation is positioned in each group, below consensus row.

				- Default: PSIPRED with BLAST+
				- If not found, PSIPRED single will be used (No BLAST+)

<b>Additional Features</b>
1. Ruler shows the position of each amino acid
2. Drawing pad
	a. Right-click: to draw
	b. Left-click: to erase
3. Slider can be used to show and hide columns based on conservation percentage.
	a. Range: 0 (left-most) to 100% (right-most)
	b. Notes:
		- This function is supplemental to column colors. Most often will show one purple shade at a time based on %conservation of each column, set on the slider.
	c. How to use:
		- Tick to activate slider.
		- Move the slider and only specific columns with similar %conservation will show at a time.
		- e.g. Tick: 50%. This will show columns having 50% similar elements.
4. Custom conservation percentage by selecting specific area
	a. Mark the first and last position on the ruler. A window will pop up to ask for confirmation.
	b. %Conservation will be positioned in each group, in the last row.
5. Adjust consensus threshold
	a. Default
6. Word search
	a. Fill in the search bar with relevant keywords on top of the page
	b. Matched words will be highlighted in orange.


<b>Biological relevance</b>
1. The first sequence in the reference group is used to predict secondary structure. This makes the data more biologically relevant compared to building using consensus sequences.
2. %Conservation against reference group is done using consensus sequences.

TO-DO
** Prolly remove all other than Linux
** Prolly remove this for ss prediction - Online or offline mode **try to make it work
** See if psipred single works
** Fix the max seq length to 1000
### - NEED TO INSTALL SOFTWARES & PYTHON DEPENDENCIES FROM .gitignore - ###
### -  POSSIBLY DELETE ALL FOR MAC & WINDOWS SINCE PSIPRED DON'T WORK - ###
** seqname w special characters - replace w _ (from inputtext n file dou)
